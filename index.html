    <p>Welcome to the class! My name is Shane Panter and I will be your instructor for this course. 
        For many students, this will be the first time you have been exposed to web development topics. 
        This course has been designed to take someone who has never seen these concepts before to being able to 
        produce relatively complex programs in 16 weeks. This class is a three credit course and it is specifically 
        designed to require 8 to 10 hours of work each week. In order to succeed in the course, it will be critical 
        for you to manage your time effectively and keep up with the reading and lab activities. Please take some 
        time to get familiar with the course website. Pay close attention to when the homework assignments are due 
        to ensure you get everything in on time.</p>
